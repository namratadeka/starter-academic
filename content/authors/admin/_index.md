Hello! I am a masterâ€™s student at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), Vancouver working on causal and fair representation learning using statistical kernel-based measures under the supervision of [Dr. D.J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml/) while also collaborating with [Dr. Arthur Gretton](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/) from the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).

I am also a machine learning research intern at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/) and have previously interned at the [Visual Intelligence and Learning Lab](https://vilab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) where I worked on learning sparse representations of articulated objects from videos and optical flow to create robotic object models.

Prior to starting grad school, I was a research fellow at [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/) for two years where I was involved in the research and development of an AI-powered visual screening tool to detect low birth-weight (<2.5kg) babies in rural India where primary healthcare is inadequate. I have also interned at Microsot Research India's Applied Sciences group on prototyping machine learning techniques to identify highly imbalanced P.I.I. attributes from massive customer databases for the EU GDPR mandate.
