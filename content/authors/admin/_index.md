I am a Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by [Dr. Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) and [Dr. Jeff Schneider](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~schneide/). My current research focus is on developing theory and algorithms to learn causal representations for reinforcement learning, generative modelling, video understanding and robustness in deep learning. I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) where I worked on invariant and fair representation learning using kernel-based measures, advised by [Dr. Danica J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml/).

I have held machine learning research intern positions at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/), the [Visual Intelligence and Learning Lab](https://vilab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and the Applied Sciences group at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). I also have full-time experience as a research fellow at [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/).
 <!-- where I was involved in the development of an AI-powered visual screening tool to detect low birth-weight (<2.5kg) babies in rural India where primary healthcare is inadequate. -->
