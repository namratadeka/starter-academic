Hello! I am a master's student at UBC, Vancouver working on kernel-based representation learning for computer vision applications under the supervision of [Dr. D.J. Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml/).

Before joining UBC, I was a research fellow at [Wadhwani AI](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/) where I helped develop a visual weighing machine to detect low birth-weight babies in rural India. I am also interested in working towards wildlife conservation and sustainable development for climate change solutions.
